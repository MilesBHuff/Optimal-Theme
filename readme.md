# Optimal-Theme

This repository defines and contains configurations for "Optimal", a theme and
colourscheme for many different applications.

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## About

This theme and colour-scheme are designed to minimize eyestrain.  They're also
intended to support a very broad number of applications, so that a consistent
look can be achieved throughout the desktop.  Specifics regarding their design
can be found in "/specification".

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
## Usage

Settings for various applications are stored in the "/config" folder.  Although
the configuration files in this repository contain only colour- and theme-
specific settings, some of them are supposed to contain more than just that --
so make sure that you don't just blindly overwrite any pre-existing settings
files on your computer.
